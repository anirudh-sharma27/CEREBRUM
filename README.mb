This is a personal project for a cognitive ai which can help with the following:

-interview helper
-fog log
-games
-memory checker
etc.

there have been some changes to the project and now it shall encompass more of nlp including voice to text and a voice of its own.
lets hope this works out and is a good project

There were some problems with the api being exposed but it has been largely resolved for now
Basic llm has been made now we proceed to speech to text

(we did  not proceed to speech to text)
(i lost my mind)

note to self:dont try speech to text on whisper or you may consult a therapist


**remember to make the talking a continous loop - done

**daily logs can be categorized and the llm should read meaningful things not just the last prompt
#it is taking too much time


we need to evolve this project into something bigger
and also divide the interview taker


need to make more progress

jounals ipdate


the only thing left are the recall feature(rl so might take time)

oh and the whole as ui which we only have 10 days to learn so good luck
